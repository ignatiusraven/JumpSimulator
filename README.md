JumpSimulator
=============

Jump code from various platform games, and a simulator to try them out.

This is a research project with the aim of understanding what types
of jumping mechanics game developers use in 2D platform-jumping games.
We also wish to understand which jumping mechanics are the most
realistic, the easiest to implement, and the most fun to play with.
